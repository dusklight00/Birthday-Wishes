You have been a true mentor and an inspiration. Your dedication, guidance, and knowledge have made a significant differences in not only in just my future but for all the others too. Your teachings have an amazing way to make complex things feel manageable, and i believe its rare to find someone who cares soo deeply and invests soo much in their students. I feel blessed by god to have such a chance to learn from such a powerful, independent and selfless teacher who will go above and beyond for her students. And clearly god has placed you in this role because you have the power to make a difference in so many students lives. Ma'am i wish you a very happy birthday filled with happiness, where you are surrounded by all the people who love you as much as we all do. May this year and all the years henceforth bring you all the success, happiness and many many happy and memorable moments. Thank you ma'am for your commitment and compassion as what you do shows that there is dedication to a purpose greater than oneself. Once again a very Happy Birthday ma'am !!!!!!",
